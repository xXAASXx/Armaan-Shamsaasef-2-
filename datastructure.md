# Data Structures


## Week 1
Python Lists Vs Dictionaries

List is a collection of index values pairs as that of array in JS. Dictionary is a hashed structure of key and value pairs.
InfoDB Lists
KVDb = []
#### List with dictionary records placed in a list  
```
ASDb.append({  
               "FirstName": "Armaan",  
               "LastName": "Shamsaasef",  
               "Date Of Birth": "November 17, 2004",  
               "Location": "San Diego",  
               "Personal Email": "armaan.shamsaasef@gmail.com",    
              })  
 ```
              
Print the second car from Mortensenâ€™s Owns_Cars list
```
x = InfoDb[0]["Coding_Languages"][1] 
result: John Mortensen
```
There is also a method called get() on the Dictionary(InfoDb[0]) that will give you the same result:
```
x = InfoDb[0].get("Coding_Languages")[2]
result: CSS
```

Print Content from InfoDB
#### given an index this will print InfoDb content
```
def print_data(n):
    print(InfoDb[n]["FirstName"], InfoDb[n]["LastName"])  # using comma puts space between values
    print("\t", "Cars: ", end="")  # \t is a tab indent, end="" make sure no return occurs
    print(", ".join(InfoDb[n]["Owns_Cars"]))  # join allows printing a string list with separator
    print()

def tester():
    print("For loop")
    for_loop()
    print("While loop")
    while_loop(0)  # requires initial index to start while
    print("Recursive loop")
    recursive_loop(0)  # requires initial index to start recursion
 ```

While Loop
#### while loop contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1)
```
def while_loop(n):
    while n < len(InfoDb):
        print_data(n)
        n += 1
    return
```
 
For Loop
#### for loop iterates on length of InfoDb
```
def for_loop():
    for n in range(len(InfoDb)):
        print_data(n)
```
        
## Tri 3 TT0 Python Menu, Replit, Github
Python Menu w/ data structures and try/except statements
```
# menu.py - function style menu

# each import enables us to use logic that has been abstracted to other files and folders
import loopy

# Two styles are supported to execute abstracted logic
# 1. file names will be run by exec(open("filename.py").read())
# 2. function references will be executed directly file.function()

    ["Stringy", "stringy.py"],
    ["Listy", "listy.py"],

## Week 0

Final Idea: Site that gives Coding questions, with rewards and surprises for each correct answer (Level System).

Our project is dedicated to the learning, improvement, and utmost enjoyment of coding! We aspire to help beginners improve their coding ability by implementing a series of levels that increase difficulty as they complete the tasks. By the end, they should see themselves as better programmers than before while also having enjoyed the journey. We are Team Siuuuu and are sponsored by Hackclub, a group of coders hoping to teach beginner coders.
