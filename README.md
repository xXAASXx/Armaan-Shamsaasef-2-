### 5.1 Notes
- Creating Innovation designed with grouping
- Single effects can be viewed as beneficial and harmful by different or same people
### 5.2 Notes
- A decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs
- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.
- An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem

### 5.3 Notes
- Sequential computing is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time
- Parallel computing is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously.
- Distributed computing is a computational model in which multiple devices are used to run a program
- Comparing efficiency of solutions can be done by comparing the time it takes to perform the same task
- A sequential solution takes as long as the sum of all of its steps
- A parallel computing solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks.
- The “speedup” of a parallel solution is measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel
### 5.4 Notes/ Corrections
- I accidentally got this wrong because I did not read the answer fully and went with the first answer that I thought looked correct. The correct answer is D and not A because crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet. Therefore, this application would benefit from the use of crowdsourcing the most, as the application could allow users to contribute descriptions and photographs of landmarks.
### 5.5 Notes
- Plagirism and copying
- Use of material by others creates legal concerns
- NOT GOOD TO DO!!!
### 5.6 Notes 
- Information on the Internet is hard to delete
- Also used for other purposes

## 5.1 Github Actions
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
Beneficial: Firstly, computers can store endless amounts of information and can help reduce the wastage of natural resources that goes into the production of paper, books, supplies. Secondly, computing connects users with millions of people across the internet through messages, social media, and more. This used to not be possible without the development of technology and computer automation. Thirdly,

Harmful: Firstly, too much use of technology can make you addicted to unrealistic things without experiencing proper social interactions that are crucial. Secondly, computing and the distribution of private information online is a prominent issue in our world and is very hard to prevent. Lastly, a heavy reliance on technology and computing can remove the need to do things individually as we now rely on something other than ourselves.

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
Answer: Dopamine issues are where you are too addicted to doing something to the point where you rely on the pleasure it gives rather than its harmful consequences. For example, I have fallen into the trap of playing video games and watching YouTube instead of preparing for school because of the pleasure I received in the moment from the release of dopamine. It can effect school and physical performance if that is the only thing you focus on.
