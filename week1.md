# Notes for Week 1

## 5.3 Notes
### Computing Bias

- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development


## 5.4 Notes
### Crowdsourcing

Public Data Sets:
- Kaggle
- Google Public Datasets
- Data.gov
- Local Government Widespread access to info and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions and dissemination of results.

Distributed Computing:
- A ton of computers do 1 task Examples:
- Spotify with collab playlists
- Crowdfunding like kickstarter and GoFundMe
- Blockchain like crypto and other tokens


### 5.3 GitHub Actions
Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
- Yes, beacause the company has a consistant bias that keeps happening.
How do you think this happened?
- The company HP makes people have a specific mindset which allows them to talk with promomting their own company as a whole.
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
- This bias is not harmful as but could be dangerous as they can know more things about you everyday. 
Should it be corrected?
- I believe it should be corrected so that people don't get their infornmation stolen. 
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
- Not hearing everything and only understanding specific details. 

### 5.4 GitHub Actions
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

- My crowdsearch idea is to find differerent water sources as this is a problem around the world. Many countries suffer from water shortages and if we are able to get the correct data we can construct a way of helping. 

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

- I believe crowdsourcing can make a website a lot better but it would have to be controlled with specific algorithms. Crowdsourcing allows a lot more opinions to be made and different biases take place into making the project as a whole, a whole lot better.
