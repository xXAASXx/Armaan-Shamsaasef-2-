### 5.1 Notes
- Creating Innovation designed with grouping
- Single effects can be viewed as beneficial and harmful by different or same people
### 5.2 Notes
- A decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs
- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.
- An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
Beneficial: Firstly, computers can store endless amounts of information and can help reduce the wastage of natural resources that goes into the production of paper, books, supplies. Secondly, computing connects users with millions of people across the internet through messages, social media, and more. This used to not be possible without the development of technology and computer automation. Thirdly,

Harmful: Firstly, too much use of technology can make you addicted to unrealistic things without experiencing proper social interactions that are crucial. Secondly, computing and the distribution of private information online is a prominent issue in our world and is very hard to prevent. Lastly, a heavy reliance on technology and computing can remove the need to do things individually as we now rely on something other than ourselves.

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
Answer: Dopamine issues are where you are too addicted to doing something to the point where you rely on the pleasure it gives rather than its harmful consequences. For example, I have fallen into the trap of playing video games and watching YouTube instead of preparing for school because of the pleasure I received in the moment from the release of dopamine. It can effect school and physical performance if that is the only thing you focus on.

How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- You can empower yourself in a digital world by staying informed about technologies and using them in your daily life. Being educated and provided with tech will help empower people in a digital environment.

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS
- Someone that is empowered can help someone that may not be empowered by providing them with a secure network or their devices with them. For example, at Del Norte, I could give my hotspot to people that may not have strong access to the internet so that they could use online services or I can share a device with them.

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Redtaping is blocking digital empowerment because it makes people have to follow additional steps in order to access information or technologies. We see this type of thing occurring in many circumstances, not necessarily in just tech. We have similar barriers at Del Norte when we try to connect ourselves to web services through a universal network for students. This field requires a password and other information in order to gain access.
