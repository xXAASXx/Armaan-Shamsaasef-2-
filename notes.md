# Notes for Week 2
## 5.5 Actions

#### 1.

- Creative Commons - Good for a project where you do not mind anyone using it any way they want
- Open Source MIT - Good for a project where you can use code freely and distribute closed versions.
- Open Source GPL - Good for project where people can use your code but they cannot distribute closed versions

#### 2. 

- We picked a MIT license because there is not much reason for anybody to distribute the poway CTE website and its code. Additionally, the only conditions to it are that we must disclose the license and copyright information when we distribute the website.

## 5.6 Actions

#### 1.

- I have seen PII on my about me page on previous csp projects, like my name, age, facts about me, and a picture.

#### 2.

- I think we need to be careful when disclosing personal information online, because it could get into the wrong hands. But for things like social media, I think PII is a good thing because it makes it easier to get to know people. 

#### 3.

- Good passwords are usually unique codes that consist of numbers, letters, and maybe some symbols. Bad passwords could contain personal information about you, numbers representing your birthday or other meaningful things, and other personal information. Other steps that assist in authentication include verification emails that are sent containing a 6 digit code. 

#### 4.

- Symmetric encryption uses one key that is shared by multiple users looking to recieve information. Asymmetric encryption uses a public and private key when decrypting messages.

#### 5.

- In deployment, we used HTTPS to encrypt our website. This uses a TLS protocol to send HTTP data/files to the user that is encrypted data.

#### 6.

- One phishing technique I could have fallen for was entering my email into a public wifi service because I needed to connect to the internet temporarily. It has not come back to bite me yet, but that information could have been stored somewhere I didn't expect. Some other Phishing techniques could be baiting people using an input that looks like a similar, trusted program, like a fake pop up ad that looks like facebook, but is not in reality.


## 5.5 Notes

- The use of material created by someone else without permission is plagiarism and could have legal consequences.
- Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of the creator/organization.
- Ease of access and distribution of digitized info raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use.
- Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property.
- Intellectual Property (IP): a work or invention that is the result to creativity to which one has rights.
- Copyright protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give permission.
- Creative Commons: publi copyright license that enables the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. Used when the content creator wants to give others the right to share, use, and build upon the work they made.
- Open source: programs are made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.
- Open access: online research output free of any and all restriction on access and free of many restrictions of use, like copyright/license restrictions.
- The use of material created by someone else should always be cited.
- Creative Commons, Open source, and Open access have enabled broad access to digital info.

## 5.6 Notes

- Personally identifiable information (PII) is information about an individual that indentifies, links, relates, or describes them.
   - Examples include: Social Security number, age, race, phone number, medical info, financial info, biometric data.
   - PII can be used to enhance a user's experience, or can be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored.
- Search engines and websites can maintain a historu of searches that individuals make.
- Devices can collect information about a user's location.
- Authentication measures protect devices from unauthorized access. 
   - Examples include strong passwords or multifactor authentication.
- Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection.
- Phishing is a technique that attempts to trick a user into providing personal info. That info can then be used to access other resources like emails and bank account info.
- Keylogging is the use of a program to record keystrokes made by a computer user to gain access to passswords.
- Data can be intercepted when sent over public networks, like through a rogue access point, a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks.

# Notes for Week 1

## 5.3 Notes
### Computing Bias

- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development


## 5.4 Notes
### Crowdsourcing

Public Data Sets:
- Kaggle
- Google Public Datasets
- Data.gov
- Local Government Widespread access to info and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions and dissemination of results.

Distributed Computing:
- A ton of computers do 1 task Examples:
- Spotify with collab playlists
- Crowdfunding like kickstarter and GoFundMe
- Blockchain like crypto and other tokens


### 5.3 GitHub Actions
Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
- Yes, beacause the company has a consistant bias that keeps happening.
How do you think this happened?
- The company HP makes people have a specific mindset which allows them to talk with promomting their own company as a whole.
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
- This bias is not harmful as but could be dangerous as they can know more things about you everyday. 
Should it be corrected?
- I believe it should be corrected so that people don't get their infornmation stolen. 
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
- Not hearing everything and only understanding specific details. 
### 5.4 GitHub Actions
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

- My crowdsearch idea is to find differerent water sources as this is a problem around the world. Many countries suffer from water shortages and if we are able to get the correct data we can construct a way of helping. 

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

- I believe crowdsourcing can make a website a lot better but it would have to be controlled with specific algorithms. Crowdsourcing allows a lot more opinions to be made and different biases take place into making the project as a whole, a whole lot better. 


# Notes for Week 0

### 5.1 Notes
- Creating Innovation designed with grouping
- Single effects can be viewed as beneficial and harmful by different or same people
### 5.2 Notes
- A decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs
- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.
- An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem


### 5.1 Github Actions
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
Beneficial: Firstly, computers can store endless amounts of information and can help reduce the wastage of natural resources that goes into the production of paper, books, supplies. Secondly, computing connects users with millions of people across the internet through messages, social media, and more. This used to not be possible without the development of technology and computer automation. Thirdly,

Harmful: Firstly, too much use of technology can make you addicted to unrealistic things without experiencing proper social interactions that are crucial. Secondly, computing and the distribution of private information online is a prominent issue in our world and is very hard to prevent. Lastly, a heavy reliance on technology and computing can remove the need to do things individually as we now rely on something other than ourselves.

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
Answer: Dopamine issues are where you are too addicted to doing something to the point where you rely on the pleasure it gives rather than its harmful consequences. For example, I have fallen into the trap of playing video games and watching YouTube instead of preparing for school because of the pleasure I received in the moment from the release of dopamine. It can effect school and physical performance if that is the only thing you focus on.

### 5.2 Github Actions
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- You can empower yourself in a digital world by staying informed about technologies and using them in your daily life. Being educated and provided with tech will help empower people in a digital environment.

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS
- Someone that is empowered can help someone that may not be empowered by providing them with a secure network or their devices with them. For example, at Del Norte, I could give my hotspot to people that may not have strong access to the internet so that they could use online services or I can share a device with them.

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Redtaping is blocking digital empowerment because it makes people have to follow additional steps in order to access information or technologies. We see this type of thing occurring in many circumstances, not necessarily in just tech. We have similar barriers at Del Norte when we try to connect ourselves to web services through a universal network for students. This field requires a password and other information in order to gain access.
